# Trailblazer DPS calcs

_Note: depending on the regions you unlock and the gear you have, the numbers
here could vary a bit. The calculations here are less about seeing exact DPS and
more about seeing what weapons are better than others._

tassets, avernic defender (if 1h), rune gloves, dragon boots
